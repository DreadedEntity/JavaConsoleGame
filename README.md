# JavaConsoleGame

This project is meant to be a re-make of a decently complex console game I originally wrote in C++, but lost the source code for.
To run this "game", use an IDE and compile&run.
Alternately, you can export as a .jar and create a new text file in the same directory. Type "java -jar JavaConsoleGame.jar" inside the file and save it as a .bat. Then simply double click on the newly created .bat file.
